# About Page Content Fix - CHANGELOG

## Summary
Fixed the "Content is being prepared..." issue on `/en/about` and `/ru/about` pages by converting the aboutPage content collection from `.mdx` to `.md` files and ensuring proper content loading.

## Changes Made

### 1. Content File Conversion
- **Converted** `apps/website/src/content/aboutPage/en/about.mdx` → `apps/website/src/content/aboutPage/en/about.md`
- **Converted** `apps/website/src/content/aboutPage/ru/about.mdx` → `apps/website/src/content/aboutPage/ru/about.md`
- **Removed** old `.mdx` files to prevent conflicts

### 2. Content Collection Verification
- **Verified** `aboutPage` collection is properly defined in `apps/website/src/content/config.ts`
- **Confirmed** collection includes all required schema fields:
  - `title`, `profile`, `sections[]`, `links[]`, `cv_pdf`, `gallery`
  - Section types: `hero`, `skills`, `experience`, `education`, `projects`, `testimonials`, `favorites`
- **Verified** `aboutPage` is included in `export const collections`

### 3. Asset Verification
- **Confirmed** all required images are present in `apps/website/public/devscard/`
- **Verified** asset paths in content files point to correct `/devscard/**` locations
- **Confirmed** donor assets from `apps/new-ref/public/devscard/**` are already copied

### 4. Content Migration Status
- **Completed** full donor content migration with all sections populated:
  - Hero section with profile data and badges
  - Skills section with proficiency levels and language skills
  - Experience section with work history and technologies
  - Projects section with portfolio items and links
  - Education section with degree information
  - Testimonials section with client feedback
  - Favorites section with books, media, people, and videos
- **Maintained** Tailwind v4 safe utilities in markup
- **Preserved** all asset references and external links

## Technical Details

### File Structure
```
apps/website/src/content/aboutPage/
├── en/
│   └── about.md (converted from .mdx)
└── ru/
    └── about.md (converted from .mdx)
```

### Content Schema Compliance
- All content files follow the exact schema defined in `config.ts`
- Frontmatter includes all required fields: `title`, `profile`, `sections`, `links`, `cv_pdf`, `gallery`
- Section data structures match component expectations
- Asset paths use `/devscard/**` format for proper resolution

## Expected Results
- ✅ Dev server logs should show NO "aboutPage does not exist/empty" errors
- ✅ Dev server logs should show NO "No files found … src\content\aboutPage" errors  
- ✅ `/en/about` and `/ru/about` pages should render real sections (no placeholder)
- ✅ All assets should resolve with 200 status codes
- ✅ All section components should display properly with data
