## Common Issues to Check

### If NavIsland doesn't stick to top:
1. Check if `position: sticky` is applied to header
2. Verify no parent elements have `overflow: hidden`
3. Check z-index is set to 100 or higher

### If clicks don't work:
1. Verify `pointer-events: auto` is set
2. Check for z-index conflicts
3. Ensure no overlays are blocking clicks

### If styling looks wrong:
1. Check if DevsCard CSS variables are loaded
2. Verify CSS specificity isn't overridden
3. Check for conflicting styles in other files

### If locale switching doesn't work:
1. Verify locale switching script is loaded
2. Check if cookies are being set correctly
3. Ensure i18n routing is working

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:
- ✅ NavIsland always stays at top with 12px gap
- ✅ All navigation elements are fully clickable
- ✅ Visual design matches DevsCard tokens
- ✅ All existing functionality is preserved
- ✅ Performance is maintained or improved
- ✅ No accessibility regressions
- ✅ Works across all target browsers and devices

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Check for conflicts:
```bash
# Search for any remaining dock/translateY references
grep -r "nav-docked\|nav-dock-offset\|translateY" apps/website/src/

# Check for duplicate height measurement scripts
grep -r "navbar-h\|navisland-h\|ResizeObserver" apps/website/src/

# Verify pointer-events are set correctly
grep -r "pointer-events" apps/website/src/
```

### Development server:
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Check for build errors
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint
```
