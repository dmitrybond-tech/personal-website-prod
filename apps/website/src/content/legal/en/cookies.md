# Cookie Policy (Strictly Necessary Only)

_Last updated: 02 Oct 2025_

We use **only strictly necessary cookies** and/or local storage to ensure the site renders correctly (e.g., locale and theme), maintain basic security, and support essential features. **We do not use analytics or advertising cookies.**

## 1. What we set
- **Locale cookie** (e.g., `site_locale`) — remembers your language (`/en` or `/ru`), so pages open in the right locale.  
- **Theme storage** (e.g., `theme` in localStorage or a cookie) — keeps dark/light preference.  
- **Session/anti-abuse** (if present) — short-lived technical tokens to protect the site.

> Names and lifetimes may differ by build. We keep lifetimes as short as reasonably possible.

## 2. Third-party embeds
If we embed strictly necessary third-party widgets, they may set their own essential cookies under their policies. We configure them in a privacy-preserving way and do not load analytics/marketing modules.

## 3. Managing cookies
You can control cookies in your browser settings. Blocking strictly necessary cookies may break core functionality.
